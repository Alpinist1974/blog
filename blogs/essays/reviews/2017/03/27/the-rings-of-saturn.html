  <p><em>Everything has returned. Sirius, and the spider, and thy thoughts at this moment, and this last thought of thine that all things will return.</em></p>

<p><em>- Friedrich Nietzsche</em></p>

<p>I’ve only just recently read W.G. Sebald’s 1995 novel, <em>The Rings of Saturn,</em> though it has been available in English since 1998. I’ve found the experience so remarkable however, that I feel compelled to write about it here. I’d heard of Sebald even before his untimely death in 2001, though I was not at the time moved to pick up any of the two or three novels then available in English (Sebald wrote in German). The one or two mentions I’d read of his work, as I recall, focused on the odd hybrid form of his novels - part history, part memoir, part travelogue, etc -and I think it was this description that left me cold.</p>

<p>But after watching part of Grant Gee’s film “Patience (After Sebald),” I decided to give <em>The Rings of Saturn</em> a read. While I’ve not yet read Sebald’s other works, I can say without a doubt that <em>Rings</em> is one of the most haunting and remarkable novels I’ve read in quite a while, yet most online reviews I’ve seen hardly do it justice.</p>

<p>It is certainly true that the novel details the travels of a man, resembling in many ways the author, through the Suffolk countryside in England over a period of days in August in the early 1990s. But this synopsis is like stating that Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> is about a man walking around Dublin for a day. In fact though, <em>Ulysses</em> seems to me a good point of departure for a discussion of <em>The Rings of Saturn</em>, as both works are similar in the intellectual complexity of their composition. Both are so deeply imbued with materials of cultural, historical and philosophical significance that they may be rightfully considered encyclopedic novels. But where <em>Ulysses</em> encapsulates the zeitgeist of modernism primarily through the consciousness of Stephen Dedalus, Sebald’s narrator may be the first character to adequately represent the post-historical consciousness of the Anthropocene.</p>

<p>To again extend the comparison with <em>Ulysses</em>, Dedalus famously proclaimed, “History…is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.” While we can consider this in the modernist context of Ezra Pound’s famous dictum, “Make It New!”, Dedalus is also historically embedded in his culture, through which he is ironically re-enacting scenes from one of its foundational narratives, Homer’s *Odyssey.</p>

<p>The Rings of Saturn* however is post-historical in that it represents a closed loop. As the title image alludes, and especially the first and last chapters, the narrative and the history contained within it are circular, locked in an eternal orbit around the planet Saturn, whose namesake is often represented as “Father Time” or “The Grim Reaper.” Eternal recurrence, that is, the cyclical nature of existence, is the primary motif of this novel.</p>

<p>The term “Anthropocene” has recently been proposed as the title for the new epoch of geologic history in which humanity has overwhelmingly impacted the health of our planet’s natural systems, though there is debate as to when that period may have begun. Some scientists argue the period began as early as 15,000 years ago, while scientists have more recently offered the dates 1610, 1945, and 1964 as candidates for the start of the Anthropocene.</p>

<p>In any case, the term was not widely discussed until 2000, when it was associated with atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen. This is five years after the publication of <em>The Rings of Saturn</em>; nevertheless, as I will argue, Sebald’s novel is an exemplary representation of the Anthropocene mode of consciousness–that is, an awareness informed by the historically and culturally linked devastation of humanity on the landscape and natural systems that appear throughout the novel. The book is not merely tinged with an atmosphere of decay and decline–it is a geographic (and geologic) survey of a landscape that has been inhabited for hundreds of years by a culture of death.</p>

<p>##Eternal Recurrence and the Culture of Death</p>

<p>In the first pages of the novel, the narrator repeatedly makes reference to the “dog days of August” and the Dog Star (Sirius), itself a symbol of cyclical nature and eternal return, to underscore the centrality of this concept to the rest of the novel. He begins here to place the major event of the novel - his walk through Suffolk - in the context of his decision to write about it, a year later to the day, when he is stricken immobile and taken to the hospital in Norwich.</p>

<p>From his hospital bed, he remarks “Several times during the day I felt a desire to assure myself of a reality I feared had vanished forever by looking out of that hospital window, which for some strange reason, was draped with black netting;” It is in the hospital in Norwich that the narrator first becomes interested in Thomas Browne, believing Browne’s skull to reside in a - as it turns out, nonexistent- museum in the hospital. Browne, the 17th century physician, alchemist and philosopher, is discussed throughout the first chapter and then reappears in the final chapter. Compare the last sentence of the novel with the one quoted above:</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>And Sir Thomas Browne…remarks in a passage of the <em>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</em> that I can no longer find that in the Holland of his time it was customary, in a home where there had been a death, to drape black mourning ribbons over all the mirrors and all canvases depicting landscapes or people or fruits of the field, so that the soul, as it left the body, would not be distracted on its final journey, either by a reflection of itself or by a last glimpse of the land now being lost for ever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Browne is significant as the author of <em>The Garden of Cyrus</em>, which is mentioned further on in the opening chapter, and for his own views on eternal recurrence vis-a-vis his writings on alchemy, where he elaborates on the symbol of the Ouroboros - the serpent swallowing its own tail. In <em>A Letter to a Friend</em>, he writes “that the first day should make the last, that the Tail of the Snake should return into its Mouth precisely at that time, and they should wind up upon the day of their Nativity, is indeed a remarkable Coincidence, which tho Astrology hath taken witty pains to salve, yet hath it been very wary in making Predictions of it.” The Ouroboros like the rings of Saturn, represent time as a closed, infinitely cycling system.</p>

<p>There are other subtler allusion to Browne’s philosophy. In one, the narrator has consulted an Oxford historian to try and ascertain the whereabouts of Browne’s skull and what may have happened to the no longer extant hospital museum. He finds that Browne’s remains had been several times disinterred and reburied, and quotes the physician-alchemist from his <em>Urn Burial</em>: “But, he adds, who is to know the fate of his bones, or how often he is to be buried?”</p>

<p>Recounting Browne’s biography and historical contributions, the narrative focuses in on one event in particular, for which there is only conjectural evidence of Browne’s attendance. This event is the medical dissection of Aris Kindt, a petty thief hanged for his crimes and immortalized by Rembrandt in the painting <em>The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp.</em> This scene is of central significance however, and is a sort of coda for the rest of the novel, and all the more for the fact that the narrator twice stresses that there is no evidence that Browne was even in attendance. Further, in one of his many stylistic idiosyncrasies, Sebald chooses to publish not one but two photographic plates - one of the painting in its entirety, and one of a detail of Aris Kindt’s dissected hand.</p>
